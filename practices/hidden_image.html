            <p>The Author J.K. Rowling had the idea for the story of Harry Potter one day on a delayed train in 1990.
                She had always loved fantasy and so came the idea of the series.
                She wanted to create a world where a child could escape adult authority, so the after the intial concept came an epic seven book series.
                She saw the books as a way to share her passion for reading with a new generation. 
                The series was based on her own hardship of losing her mother, so the books provided an escape and a sense of power that she felt was missing from her own.
                Her finshed writing her first book, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone</em>, in 1995. It was then published on June 26, 1997. The book was a huge hit and it was follwed by the next six. The seventh book, <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em>, was released on July 21, 2007.
                From a simple idea on a train, became one of the most famous book series of all time.</p>
